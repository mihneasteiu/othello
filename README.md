# Othello

This repository contains my implementation of **Othello**, a strategy-based board game with human and computer players. It was developed using Java and JavaFX, as part of the **[CS15 (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming)](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0150/)** course at Brown University. The project covers event-driven GUI programming in JavaFX, polymorphic class design, and artificial intelligence using the Minimax algorithm. You can find more information about the project [here](https://hackmd.io/@Fall2024-CS15/rJZGUBRo0)

## Project Overview

Othello is played on an 8×8 board and supports:

- Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer, and Computer vs. Computer play modes.
- Turn-based logic with valid move detection and tile flipping.
- Graphical interface for gameplay using JavaFX.
- AI opponents that use the recursive Minimax algorithm with multiple difficulty levels.
- Live score tracking and player indicators.

### Technical Highlights

- Implemented a polymorphic `Player` interface for human and computer players.
- Designed a recursive Minimax algorithm with board evaluation heuristics.
- Managed gameplay flow and animations using JavaFX.
- Used a separate logical board for AI move simulation.
- Built a modular and extensible architecture with clear separation of concerns.
